Cellula
================

Description
-----------

Cellula aims to be a framework for building, running and studying
cellular automata.

My main goal with Cellula is to *study* cellular automata, not only to *run*
them, so don't expect fancy graphics.

Another goal is to provide a simple DSL, allowing non-programmers to use
Cellula. Following is an example of Cellula DSL:

``` ruby
automaton "Test CA" do
  dimensions 1
  type       :elementary
  width      20
  rule       :wolfram_code_110
end

study "Test CA" do
  method      :random
  generations 4
end
```

Save the previous example in a file named `my_automaton.rb` and
launch it with:

    cellula path/to/my_automaton.rb


Install
-------------------------

    gem install cellula

Usage
--------------------------
*This is a work in progress. More documentation is comingâ€¦*

### automaton specifications

* dimensions
  Number of dimensions of the grid. Currently Cellula supports only
  1D grids.
* type
  Type of the automaton. Currently only :elementary (one-dimensional, 2
  possible states per cell, neighbors are the immediate neighbors' cells.
* width
  Width of the grid.
* rule
  Currently only Wolfram code.

### study specifications

* method
  The study's method. Could be :random or :single. (View doc/study.rb
  for more details)
* generations
  Number of generations to process.

Dependencies
--------------------------

  * ruby >= 2.0.0
